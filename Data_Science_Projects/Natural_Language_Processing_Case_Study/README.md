# Viterbi algorithm for POS tagging
Accomplish the following in this case study:

1) Write the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
2) Solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc. Note that to implement these techniques, you can either write separate functions and call them from the main Viterbi algorithm, or modify the Viterbi algorithm, or both.
3) Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
